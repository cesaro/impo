IMPO - Inverse Method based on Partial Orders
=============================================

IMPO is a research tool to perform synthesis of time parameters in a
Parametrized Time Petri Net.
It implements a generalization of the Inverse Method (IM) from sequential
executions to partially-ordered executions.

The underlying theoretical results have been published in our paper ACSD'15.

More details to come.
